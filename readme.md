# 📚 EDUAI Assessment Engine (Backend)

**A Scalable, Multi-Tenant RAG System for Automated Exam Generation & Evaluation.**

This backend engine leverages **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ingest educational textbooks (PDFs), understand their semantic structure, and generate high-quality question papers or evaluate student answers using **Google Gemini** and **Qdrant Vector Database**.

---

## 🚀 Key Architectural Highlights

This project was recently refactored from a monolithic script to a distributed micro-service architecture to support concurrency and scale.

### 1. Hybrid PDF Processing Engine ("Map-Then-Process")

Standard PDF chunking loses context (e.g., a chunk from page 50 loses the fact that it belongs to "Chapter 3"). We implemented a custom 2-phase pipeline:

- **Phase 1 (Stateful):** Sequentially scans the first 15-20 pages to extract the **Table of Contents** and build a `Page -> Chapter` map.
- **Phase 2 (Parallel):** Uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process the remaining pages in parallel (10x speedup). The "Chapter Map" is injected into every thread, ensuring every text chunk is "stamped" with its correct metadata before embedding.

### 2. Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation

Moved from local file-based storage (FAISS) to **Qdrant Cloud**.

- **Strict Isolation:** Every document chunk is tagged with a `user_id` in its payload.
- **Filtered Retrieval:** All RAG queries enforce a strict metadata filter (`must: [{key: "user_id", match: ...}]`), ensuring users can only retrieve from their own uploaded textbooks.

### 3. Resilient Data Ingestion

- **Batch Uploading:** Vectors are uploaded in batches of 64 to prevent `httpx.WriteTimeout` errors common with large textbooks (300+ pages).
- **Background Tasks:** PDF processing is offloaded to `fastapi.BackgroundTasks`, returning an immediate "Processing Started" response to the client to prevent HTTP blocking.

## 🧠 Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

### Why Qdrant over FAISS?

- **Problem:** FAISS (Local) is not thread-safe for concurrent writes. If User A uploaded a file while User B generated an exam, the index file would lock or corrupt.
- **Solution:** Qdrant is a server-based Vector DB. It handles concurrency natively and allows filtering by metadata (`user_id`), enabling secure multi-tenancy on a single database instance.

### Why Batch Uploads?

- **Problem:** Uploading 300+ pages of vector embeddings in a single HTTP request resulted in `httpx.WriteTimeout` exceptions.
- **Solution:** We implemented a batching logic in `services/vector_store.py` that splits payloads into groups of 64 chunks. This ensures stability even on slow network connections.

### Why Hybrid Parsing?

- **Problem:** Pure parallel processing is fast but stateless (Page 10 doesn't know about Page 9). Pure sequential processing is context-aware but slow (8 mins/book).
- **Solution:** We scan the TOC sequentially to map page numbers to chapters, then pass this map to parallel workers. This gives us **Context Awareness + Parallel Speed**.
